# Animation, Photography, and Code junkie

## What you will see on my GitHub:

* Mostly, each repo has assignments from my classes throughout the years
* Within the Python repo, I am working on converting all assignments from other languages but making them better
* I know the code for some assignments do not work properly (especially in Java and C++ repos), but that is ok! Shows I was still learning at that time.
* (Unfortunately, this is my personal account.  I have a more active account for work in which I will hopefully show here once the project is done.)
