## What you will see on my GitHub:

* Mostly, each repo has assignments from my classes throughout the years
* I know the code for some assignments do not work properly, but that is ok! Shows I was still learning at that time.



   (Unfortunately, this is my personal account.  I have a more active account for work.)
